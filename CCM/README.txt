********************************************************************************
This project contains the code to run and evaluate PCM, a parallel
content-based matching algorithm designed to efficiently run on multi-core
CPUs and on CUDA Mutiple- GPUs .

First of all setup bewoulf cluster. Refer to "http://techtinkering.com/2009/12/02/setting-up-a-beowulf-cluster-using-open-mpi-on-linux/"
copy files in cloud folder or any other
Aslo setup NFS for file sharing in cluster.
make all to compile
make clean to remove all compiled objects
mpirun -np <no of processed> --hostfile .mpi_hostfile ./CCM 1

********************************************************************************
Algorithm 1 is tested.
